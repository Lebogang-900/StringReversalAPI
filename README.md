# String Reversal API

## What the Project Does
The String Reversal API is a simple web service that takes an input string, reverses it, and checks if the original string is a palindrome. It provides an endpoint to perform these operations and returns the results in a JSON format.

## Why the Project Is Useful
This API can be useful in various applications where string manipulation is needed. It can serve as a learning tool for understanding API development with ASP.NET Core and basic string operations such as reversing and palindrome checking. Additionally, it can be integrated into larger applications that require such functionality.
